Hello Thomas,  

I hope you’re able to relax a little on this Monday.  But in case you’e looking for more to read…  my daughter and I have pieced together a VERY basic site with some of your info on it.  Check it out at https://tamacafe.tamatoledo.net when you have a minute.

Like I said, it’s VERY basic at this point, but hopefully functional.  My real hope is that search engines like Google will begin to pick it up soon so that we can get you “on the map” in terms of search engine rankings.  That process takes time.

I thought I would also send you a quick list of things I anticipate my daughter adding soon, or at least taking a crack at…

  - More style throughout.  Do you have a favorite color scheme, any logos or graphic art, would you like Mackenzie to take a shot at creating some?
  - Photos, if you want them.  I see some on your Facebook page, so I assume you’d like to use some of the same in the website.  Let us know.
  - A Google map, or equivalent, so people can click and get directions to you, if you like.
  - Google analytics, so we can track visits to your site.
  - Links to social media.  Facebook for sure, Twitter, and others might be possible.

One “special” feature that I’d like to add is the ability to harvest TODAY’s, or just your “latest”, Facebook post and reflect it on the landing/home page.  That way you can post daily special announcements or other time-sensitive info to FB (like, “Sorry, no ham left today.  Visit again tomorrow!”) and the site will automatically “harvest” it and share just today’s info with visitors.  One of the things I hate about FB is that you collect a lot of outdated stuff over time, and that’s always confusing for me.  I don’t visit FB anymore for much of anything, as I mentioned, but when I do it’s always disappointing to see “yesterday’s” information.  Makes me wonder what’s up TODAY?

In any case, please check out the site and if this looks like a good start let me know.  I think it would be wise to push the site to a more permanent address, like https://tamacafe.tamatoledo.com, as soon as possible so that Google and others can pick up on the new site.

I also have one favor to ask…  Kenneth, from Bumblebees, has asked me for a website quote and I expect to provide him the same offer that you have here.  I’m sure I don’t have to ask, but just to be safe… would you object if I share much the same info with him, and possibly point him to https://tamacafe.tamatoledo.net just so he can see what a simple, initial site can look like?

Hope to hear from you soon.  Thanks and take care.

-Mark M. and Mackenzie

Hello Thomas,

Sorry for the delayed response, and thanks again for yesterday’s lunch, and today’s too… we have been very pleased and impressed with everything you have prepared for us thus far.  I’m also encouraged that you expressed some interest in having my daughter construct a website for the cafe.  Thanks.

Based on our brief conversations, it sounds like you could benefit from having a relatively simple, inexpensive website where potential customers could find your menu, hours of operation, and contact info.  You also mentioned that you’re interested in receiving online carry-out and delivery orders via email and phone, but do not wish to require remote, electronic transactions.  I think that is a wise decision since handling money electronically comes with lots of extra fees and risk.

What you described above is not unlike what we provide for my brother-in-law and his Compass Rose Band, the CRB.  See https://thecompassroseband.com and its small, online store under https://compassroseband.net/fan-gear/ for this example.

The CRB site is typical of what we like to build for e-commerce, it’s two static Hugo (https://hugo.io) sites, the store is actually a “satellite” site of its own, it uses a form processing service from Snipcart (https://snipcart.com/).  

CRB customers click on items they wish to purchase and build a shopping cart that they can edit and submit. The store is integrated with my brother-in-law’s Square for transaction handling and he’s negotiated a no-minimum fees agreement with Snipcart (because Snipcart loves garage bands), so if the site isn’t used he pays nothing. I think their typical fee is 2% of online sales with a $10/month minimum fee total online revenue less than $500/month.  I’m not sure what fees Square adds for credit card transactions but those fees and shipping are built into the CRB’s simple pricing structure.  

When an order is placed my brother-in-law receives an email with all the transaction details including customer contact and shipping info.  He has a Snipcart “dashboard” where he can also find all the details.  He fills the orders himself, and makes a little money.  It’s that simple.

Unfortunately, I’m not sure Snipcart would work well for a restaurant because there’s no way in the order process to “customize” the product, not even a simple “Hold the mushrooms please”.  However, there are many alternatives available including simple notification APIs like “Formspree” (https://formspree.io/), or more complex, integrated solutions from folks like “Square”.

As you can see, there’s a lot to consider, so an in-person conversation would probably save us both a great deal of time.  What I can provide in this email is a proposed fee structure for your consideration.  Starting with the simplest option, which is where I suggest we begin.

Simple Brochure Site

Site building fee:  $100
Additional page building:  $25 per page
Hosting fee: $10 monthly or $100 annually.  Includes one content change per month. 
Additional content changes: $15 each
Additional graphic design: $25 / hour.  Includes taking and posting photos, logo work, etc.
Register subdomain @ TamaToledo.com: $20 / year
Custom domain registration: $25 / year plus Registrant fees (these vary by domain) 
Register additional subdomains: $5 monthly or $50 annually per subdomain
New features creation: Negotiable @ $25 / hour

These fees assume a simple, 3 or 4-page static site with no customer interaction.  I envision:

A “Landing" page with your logo/brand and critical operating info, contact details, and timely notifications;
A “Menu" page with dishes, including photos if you like, and simple phone-in order instructions;
An “About” page with anything you’d like to share, perhaps including customer testimonials or reviews.

The site would be hosted in my developer cloud at DigitalOcean (https://www.digitalocean.com/).  I’ve been a customer of theirs for about 10 years now.

Getting Started

So, a minimal site could cost as little as $100 and $120/year to host.  As I mentioned at my pick-up today, I’d like to get us started just to have something for my daughter to “showcase” in her portfolio, and to have something to show, and to build from.  

To that end, I’m going to create TamaCafe@TamaToledo.net and have my daughter populate it with a simple landing page, a page reflecting your printed menu, and a simple About page.  I chose to put this initial page at TamaToledo,net so that we can use it for testing and development without engaging a .com address, yet.

We will let you know when there’s something to see at https://TamaCafe.TamaToledo.net.  Thanks and take care.
